# Evolving Artificial Neural Network

An attempt to build a self optimizing artificial neural network. Connections with low weights should be dropped and new connections are constantly being randomly formed. Additionally, new neurons are radomly added. This should keep the neural net growing. 
Learning should be based on the hebbioan learning rule which depends on an internal reward. The internal reward is computed by a simple neural net which tries to predict the fututre external reward based on the observation.
